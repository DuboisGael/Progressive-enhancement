      In nature, <span class="good">Good</span> & Evil do not exist. The
      Universe itself is neither <span class="good">good</span> nor
      <span class="bad">bad</span>, but a potential in permanent
      development.

    <p>
      Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
      rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
      cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
      no such thing as an issue.</p>

    <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists
      if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses
      don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
      changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t
      see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
      reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
      on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s
      fake.</p>

    <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
      person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls
      from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
      the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
      like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you
      passively do it anyway.</p></br>

    <h2>The story</h2>

    <figcaption>"The Old Chinese Farmer"</figcaption>
    <br /><br />

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
      <span class="dialp">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
        This is most unfortunate.”</span>The farmer said,<span class="dialf">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>?
        Is it<span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
    in the evening everybody came back and said,
    <span class="dialp">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
      eight horses!”</span>
    The farmer again said,
    <span class="dialf">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it
      <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span></p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
    riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
    <span class="dialp">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span>
    and the farmer responded,
    <span class="dialf">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it
      <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</span>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
    into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
    Again all the neighbors came around and said,
    <span class="dialp">“Isn’t that great!”</span> Again, he said,
    <span class="dialp">“Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it
      <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</span>”</p>

    <p>he whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
    complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
    happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
    <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the
    consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
    consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just
      one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys,
      but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
      not make a big deal out of it...
